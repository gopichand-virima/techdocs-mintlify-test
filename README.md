# Virima Technical Documentation

This is a central repository to manage the docs created on Mintlify tool.

Why did I create - **test-docs-mintlify** repository? To try Mintlify supported options.

This **techdocs-mintlify-test** consits of .css and .js scripts developed from cursor which is needed for future use of .css
