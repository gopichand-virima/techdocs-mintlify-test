# **Overview**

The **Department module** in Virima provides a centralized platform for organizations to structure, manage, and maintain their departments, enabling administrators to assign users and groups to the correct departments for clear organizational alignment. By mapping permissions to departments, it enhances role-based access control, clarifies organizational structure and resource allocation, and streamlines operations through effective categorization of users and groups. This feature ensures consistency, efficiency, and accountability when creating or updating users and groups, supporting administrators in maintaining a well-defined and manageable organizational framework.
